# ðŸŽ„ Advent of code 2021 ðŸŽ„
My solutions for advent of code 2021.

## How to run
First off you need to install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

### Run all
You can run `cargo run` to show all solutions.

### Run specific day
Run `cargo run -- DAY-NUMBER` to only show the result for that specific day.

`DAY-NUMBER` is a integer between 1 and the latest solution.
